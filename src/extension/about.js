export const bankText = "Due to country-specific constraints, the consumer experienced trouble using PayPal to complete transactions. The plan was to set up a personal banking system for him that would allow him to make PayPal payments with just a credit card. The task was due in two weeks and done in two weeks or less.

I made it during high school, and being my first, it was obviously really difficult; tackling issues took me longer than usual, but that is what heavily improved my skills in software development."
